🫧 Bubble Sort Algorithm
📌 Overview

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

The process is repeated until the array is sorted.

🧠 How It Works

Compare the first two elements.

Swap if the first is greater than the second.

Move to the next pair.

After each pass, the largest element moves to the end.

Repeat for remaining elements.

| ---------- | ---------- |
| Best Case  | O(n)       |
| Average    | O(n²)      |
| Worst Case | O(n²)      |
